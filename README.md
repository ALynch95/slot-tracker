## Milestone project 2 from NNLV Bootcamp

**We developed this project using Next.js in combination with a Google SQL database. Its primary purpose is to store comprehensive information about casino records. With this system, users have the ability to create new records, make edits, perform searches, and delete data as needed.**

A project made by Liqiuzhi, Lorne Richardson, and Alexander Lynch.
